00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.904
Now, that we have our block class,

00:00:02.904 --> 00:00:06.359
we now need to construct our blockchain to store blocks.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.399
Before we make further modifications,

00:00:08.398 --> 00:00:11.329
let's go ahead and make sure to add comments to our existing code.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.640
I'm going to go ahead and paste the code block N. All right.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.429
So, now we have our block class set to class with the constructor for the block.

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:20.469
We can proceed forward.

00:00:20.469 --> 00:00:25.729
Let's add a new blockchain class called Blockchain.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.500
Just like our block class,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.950
we can configure a constructor, constructor.

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:47.239
Perfect. Now, that we have our constructor,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.844
let's go ahead and utilize an array to store our blockchain.

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:55.500
Let's call this array chain.

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:59.899
Next, let's go ahead and add our comment banner.

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.799
Perfect. So, at this point,

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:11.469
we have a blockchain class with the constructor that stores data within an array.

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:16.179
Let's go ahead and new functionality to add a block to the array.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.810
Let's go ahead and call the function addBlock.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:27.329
Within the function, let's go ahead and call the variable a newBlock.

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.649
Within our function body,

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.945
let's go ahead and add the new block to our chain.

00:01:35.944 --> 00:01:44.399
We're going to say this chain.push newBlock.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.885
Perfect. Let's go ahead and test within our terminal,

00:01:49.885 --> 00:01:52.620
utilizing a Node environment.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.859
Remember, before we went ahead and did this with the creation of our block class,

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:00.370
let's do it again with blockchain.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.625
Also we have to do now is copy our Blockchain class,

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:09.215
and we'll paste it right here within

00:02:09.215 --> 00:02:15.674
our Node environment and sure enough that's been added within our Node environment.

00:02:15.674 --> 00:02:18.275
Next, let's go ahead and test.

00:02:18.275 --> 00:02:24.430
Let's stand to aid our object and assign it to a Blockchain variable.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:35.719
Next, let's add a new block to our blockchain utilizing our addBlock method.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.819
We're just going to put in some test data,

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.454
nothing big. All right.

00:02:46.455 --> 00:02:51.700
To view the data within it, all is what we have to do is view the blockchain array,

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:56.280
and with that we can call blockchain.chain.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.539
To recap, we created a new Blockchain class with

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:06.789
a constructor to store data within side the chain

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:12.099
array with a new addBlock function that allows

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:18.159
a new block to be pushed to the chain.
