00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.005
To kick up our project,

00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:05.620
the very first thing we're going to want to do is open up

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.240
a new terminal session on the bottom right panel of workspaces like New Terminal.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.280
Within this terminal, we're going to want to navigate to our project working directory.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.425
Don't worry, we created this for you.

00:00:20.425 --> 00:00:24.485
If we go ahead and issue the command list structure, which is LS,

00:00:24.485 --> 00:00:30.080
press enter, you'll notice that we have a project working directory called Project_2.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.565
We can utilize the command change directory

00:00:33.565 --> 00:00:36.355
to navigate to that project working directory.

00:00:36.355 --> 00:00:40.095
To do this, we just simply type in cd for change directory,

00:00:40.095 --> 00:00:43.625
and then we type in the name of our directory.

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:46.039
Fantastic. At this point,

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.060
you're going to want to go ahead and initialize your project

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.130
by issuing the command for the node package manager initialization,

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:02.115
npm init, that stands for node package manager initialization.

00:01:02.115 --> 00:01:03.895
Once we have that configured,

00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:05.990
go ahead and press enter to kick it off.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.935
Now, it's going to prompt you for a few questions specific to your project.

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:13.315
Feel free to accept the defaults because at anytime,

00:01:13.315 --> 00:01:16.750
you can go ahead and edit the contents of this file.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.530
So, we're going to go ahead and accept the defaults.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.410
All right. You'll notice that it produce an output in JSON format.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.685
We kind of figured so considering the name of this file is package.json.

00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:34.755
We can see that right here.

00:01:34.755 --> 00:01:39.960
Okay. So, now that we have our package.json configured,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.660
this allows us to store project dependencies within the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.555
package.json for future installation of this project on other machines.

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:55.020
Super useful. Okay. Now, to kick things off,

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.520
to create our own private blockchain,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.800
we're going to want to create our blockchain data model,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.105
and that means that we need to look at what a block looks like.

00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:10.150
So, let's go ahead and take a look at an existing block on the testnet.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.725
On the left-hand panel of your screen,

00:02:12.725 --> 00:02:15.620
you'll notice we have Project_2 in your file explorer.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.780
Let's double-click it to open the contents.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.340
We have our package.json,

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.215
and then we have testnet_block_1325438.

00:02:23.215 --> 00:02:27.020
Let's go ahead and select testnet_block so we can reverse

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.970
engineer the data model and simplify it for our means.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.250
Let's go ahead and select everything inside

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.050
this file so we can go ahead and create our own data model.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.610
To do that, I'm going to go ahead and select

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.530
the entire contents of this file and then copy it.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.875
What I want to do is create a new file.

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:48.620
I tend to use touch.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.190
So, down in the terminal window,

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.875
I'm going to issue the command touch and I'm just going to call this notes.txt.

00:02:56.875 --> 00:03:01.475
Okay. Perfect. You'll notice in your file navigation window

00:03:01.475 --> 00:03:06.235
on the left panel of your screen, we have notes.txt.

00:03:06.235 --> 00:03:10.250
We'll open that file by double-clicking on it and it's empty.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.060
So, what we're going to do is now paste the contents from our clipboard to this file.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.410
The screen bigger. Okay. So, now,

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.090
let's go ahead and remove the data that we don't need for our data model.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.775
Remember, we are building a simplified private blockchain,

00:03:26.775 --> 00:03:30.410
meaning there is no need for a consensus algorithm at this time.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.295
Let's go ahead and remove everything other than the hash,

00:03:36.295 --> 00:03:38.775
the body of the block,

00:03:38.775 --> 00:03:45.510
the block height, the time that the block was entered into the chain,

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.230
and of course, reference to the previousblock on the blockchain.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.830
So, what we're going to do is remove everything that we don't need.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.950
So, we don't need anything that's referencing to the consensus algorithm,

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.120
we're just going to delete those.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.409
The body of our block,

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.140
we don't need any data within it because all we care about is constructing

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.990
your own private chain block data model.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.270
So, right here, we're just going to remove all this data with

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.215
inside the transaction body also known as a block body.

00:04:20.215 --> 00:04:25.220
Matter of fact, let's just rename tx with body.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.355
All right, perfect.

00:04:27.355 --> 00:04:31.450
We're going to remove merkleroot version.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.860
No need for weight, size, or confirmation,

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.295
and let's remove the data from the hash.

00:04:42.295 --> 00:04:46.240
Let's reset the block height to zero;

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.535
the time, zero; and previousblockhash, nothing. All right.

00:04:52.535 --> 00:04:55.240
That pretty much concludes what we're going to need to start

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.265
constructing our own private blockchain.

00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:00.625
Now that we defined our data model,

00:05:00.625 --> 00:05:04.270
let's go ahead and add that to our notes.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.565
Block and data model.

00:05:07.565 --> 00:05:10.370
Perfect. Well, that concludes our block data model.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.205
Next up, let's go ahead and create

00:05:12.205 --> 00:05:17.010
our own block constructor to support building out our private blockchain.
