Hi, I'm Kathleen, I lead the careers team at Udacity.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.604
We support students in their job search.

00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:08.645
The careers team knows what employers are looking for in a job candidate,

00:00:08.645 --> 00:00:12.285
and we want to work with you to market yourself as the best person for the job,

00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:13.575
whether it's a new role,

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:16.155
or a promotion at your current company.

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:20.070
You need to be proactive in your career development to be job-ready at graduation.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.515
For this reason, career services are available throughout your Nanodegree experience.

00:00:24.515 --> 00:00:25.830
It's important to remember,

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.620
while you're here to learn the technical skills for a job,

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.050
it's equally important to know how to communicate

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.510
those skills to an employer through an application,

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.690
your online profiles, and in interviews.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.155
Let's meet the careers team who will be with you along the way.

00:00:38.155 --> 00:00:41.580
Hi I'm Rachel. Along with a network of career mentors,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.010
our team is here to help you from when you begin to

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.890
look for jobs until you accept your job offer.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.585
Career support is present at different stages throughout your Nanodegree,

00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:52.480
and we encourage you to go through all of that

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.080
regardless of where you are in your job search.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.470
Udacity career services include guides, lessons,

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.724
and personalized feedback on topics like talking to recruiters,

00:01:01.724 --> 00:01:05.190
interviewing, and optimizing your online profiles.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.065
And I'm Trinh. In order to graduate career ready,

00:01:08.065 --> 00:01:10.785
you should continuously work on your career development.

00:01:10.785 --> 00:01:13.230
Like with all learning, beginning something earlier

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.420
means you're more prepared when it's time to apply that learning.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.105
When your dream job pops up,

00:01:18.105 --> 00:01:19.825
you want to be ready for it.

00:01:19.825 --> 00:01:22.035
We'll support you throughout your career development,

00:01:22.035 --> 00:01:24.340
on the forums, in career coach appointments,

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.640
and through the career resource center.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.855
Hi I'm Kirsten, and I'm head of employer relations at Udacity.

00:01:30.855 --> 00:01:32.836
Once you've completed the career curriculum,

00:01:32.836 --> 00:01:35.795
you'll be ready to apply to jobs and talk with employers.

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:38.660
Udacity partners with industry leading companies,

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.950
who are looking to hire skilled and passionate people, like you.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.561
Having hiring partners means,

00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:48.230
you'll have direct and preferential exposure at these companies.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.505
This will help give you a leg up in your job search as you explore your career options,

00:01:52.505 --> 00:01:54.710
and develop a career path unique to you.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.795
Your passion, your location,

00:01:56.795 --> 00:01:58.720
and other career goals.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.950
After you complete your first core Nanodegree projects,

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.420
you'll then be prompted to begin your career development with us.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.743
We'll be there with you from then on as you explore your career options,

00:02:06.743 --> 00:02:11.009
and pursue your dream role. We look forward to working with you.
